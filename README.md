# banking-app
Simple "banking" app, simulating basic functions.
Created as means of showing basic java skills, as well as refreshment of everything i forgot during my pause from writing.

Featuring:
-Creating user account with assignment of randomly generated account number.
-Logging in with earlier created combination of username and password.
-Account assigned balance, including 5 currencies.
-Depositing, withdrawal, transfers to another account, currency exchanges.

Overall it is quite messy, but from this level, the only way is up.
Lack of comments comes from the fact that it's my first "bigger" project, and i forgot about them. Reminder so i won't forget next time.
